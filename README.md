A sleek, responsive quiz application built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** — without using any libraries or frameworks. It features a real-time timer, score tracking, previous/next navigation, and a polished UI. All interactions are handled using native DOM methods only.
